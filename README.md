Exploratory Data Analysis helps in identifying any outlier data points, understanding the relationships between the various attributes and structure of 
the data, recognizing the important variables. It helps in framing questions and visualizing the results, paving the way to make an informed choice of 
the machine learning algorithm for the problem at hand.

While working on performing Exploratory Data Analysis, it is important that we keep our objective in mind. Plotting fancy graphs is not the aim but 
deriving useful insights is.

The objective of this analysis is To find patterns within the dataset to gain further understanding of the data and leverage it to choose a machine learning algorithm for predicting the survival rates of patients who undergo the surgery.
